# autonomous_mobile_robot
AURORA (autonomous mobile robot) is the research, conducted at IPB University, Indonesia. These codes are some parts of the development.

The codes are wrote in arduino, using LIDAR sensor.

Functions in the codes:
- LIDAR scanning
- Plot the result on XY chart
- Nose filtering (split the trees and noise)
- Create 4-lines-polygon of trees
- Calculate center point of 4-lines-polygon
- Print at a GLCD
- Store to SD card
- Robot run to the center point by control of Gyro (compass) sensor,
- Robot check the distance between robot and the 4-trees to determine the robot has been arrived or no at the center point
- finish.
